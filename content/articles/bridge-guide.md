## Intro

So I see you’ve figured your way through the duels community into the tiny corner known as&nbsp;**The Bridge**.

Either way, if you want to get better or get started this guide is for&nbsp;**you**.

It’s a bit advanced so there are a few prerequisites to consider.

You must know how to:

*   Left Click
*   Right Click
*   Have played a few games of The Bridge before

If you believe you have these down you’ll be able to tackle some of the most important aspects of the bridge.


## Terminology:

*   Block limit: the maximum height you can place blocks in the bridge.
*   Pressure: A general term to specify how often your opponents stay at their base and how often you’re at theirs.
*   First push: the absolute beginning of the game when the cage drops.
*   Cage bow: pulling your bow inside the cage and releasing it when the cage drops to try to hit your opponent.
*   Cage gap: eating a golden apple in the cage. This is important to gain the edge during the pvp fights after the cage drop.
*   Bypass: Don't kill your opponent and instead go around so they either have to void to defend you or race
*   Race: A race towards the goal means you and your opponent don't kill each other or void, and instead run to the goal hoping to get there first.


## Fundamentals:

The fundamentals are absolutely important if you want to be anywhere near good at the bridge, and they consist of wallrunning, towering, and hippoing. Below we’ll focus on each topic in detail, along with useful videos demonstrating it.

Some short tips to cover before the major ones:

*   Eat a golden apple in the cage so you have more hp going into the push
*   Don't be afraid to void when you have to. It's better to void later than never and lose the point
*   Try out cage bowing, aim a little over their cage. It's mainly muscle memory.


### Wallrunning:

Also known as wallbridging or sidebridging, this is an absolute must-know if you’re ever going to be good. If you don’t know this, don’t worry, it takes only a few hours to get it down, but many hours of practice to master.

Wallrunning is essentially jumping down to the side of the bridge and placing blocks under you as you run towards their goal.

This technique requires&nbsp; **practice**&nbsp;to build muscle memory.

The above video by cesmic is a great guide for beginners on how to wallrun.


### Towering:

Towering is an incredibly important part of bridge. You’ll want to get the high ground on them as fast as possible, while still stopping them from going around or under you (through tunnels).


![Tower on Sorcery](/images/article-specific/bridge-guide/tower.png)



{{< youtube 7et6xi7xcLc >}}

The start of this video by wez shows that both teams try to get to block limit at middle as fast as possible.

Remember to make your tower at least 2 blocks long, don’t pole up just looking down. Place blocks in front of you as you build up. This’ll make it harder to get bowed off and easier to build up to your tower later on.

{{< youtube UrjpAMt2aQ >}}

Here's yet another helpful video by cesmic on how to tower.

You should generally place your tower on&nbsp;**their side of the bridge**. Towering is especially good on&nbsp;**spawnblock maps**&nbsp;because getting the high ground faster is much more important. You should still tower on all maps.


### Hippoing:

The hippo is a really important part of the bridge. If you’re just starting out, you might overlook it, but it’s pretty much a deciding factor if you hippo or not.

Essentially, a good hippo blocks off the entrances to your goal, while being easy to defend against other people on.


![Hippo on Tundra](/images/article-specific/bridge-guide/hippo.png)


Only some maps are designated as hippo maps, while the rest are spawnblock maps. We’ll cover this in the map knowledge section of the guide.

Ideally a fast hippo is better, so knowing how to butterfly-click or jitterclick is helpful, but getting started doesn’t need it.

There are multiple hippo strats for each map. Some people only hippo the middle (on maps like aquatica/dojo) to get more offensive pressure, while some hippo the entire map.

Here's two well-known bridge players and how they hippo each map:

*   [bdamja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYchITE0o2957omYb53ahm65-n0FIUooY)
*   [TrashClient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fygkadqw7UI)

The hippo is left to the defender in a doubles or teams match. Hippos aren't as important in solo matches, but you should definitely hippo maps like urban, cheesy, and tundra in all scenarios.


## Other useful techniques:

If you've gone this far you're already 60% there. The next few techniques (aside from hippoing) are rarely used in regular play, only sweaty matches with good players. Best you learn them anyways.

### Pristining:

This is a defensive strat that’s map-specific. You’d usually use this on spawnblock maps because they’re harder for your opponent to spawnblock on. It can also be used on non-spawnblock maps to prevent bypassers, however most people don’t do it.



![Pristine on Galaxy](/images/article-specific/bridge-guide/pristine.png)


You start out pristining by putting 3 blocks along the middle and then extend it on each side. Then you can build up the second step and keep going.

People don't generally pristine in solo matches. It's normally used in doubles and teams matches.


### Spawnblocking:

This is the reason people hate spawnblock maps. It’s essentially creating a large wall on their side of the map that causes them to be really delayed to get to the top. Maps like lighthouse, condo, and twilight are notorious for this.



![spawnblock on Twilight](/images/article-specific/bridge-guide/spawnblock.png)


### Winging:

This strategy is pretty overpowered if you get a good wing built. Building a diagonal bridge out from center and bridging towards their base gives you two options to travel on to bypass your opponents. It’s best started at block limit. Widen your wing at least one more block if you have time so you don’t get bowed off.



![Wing on Urban](/images/article-specific/bridge-guide/wing.png)


To counter wings, you must bridge out to their wing from either the bridge or from your base. From bridge is better so you can take their wing if they do. Your next step is to make more bridges from the center to the wing so that it’s like a platform and better to pvp on.


### Bow combo:

Because Bridge doesn’t have fishing rods, we use bows to initiate combos sometimes. One thing you have to keep in mind is that bow shots take time to recharge, about 3 seconds for your arrow to come back.



![Bow combo on Treehouse](/images/article-specific/bridge-guide/bowcombo.png)


[Here’s an example](https://streamable.com/zfoqfy)&nbsp;of a bow combo. 

### Tunneling:

## Game Sense:

Game Sense isn’t something you can really explain, it’s something you gain through playing other people. However showing situations of games can help you develop it if you aren’t playing yourself. 


**Bridge is a game of pressure.**

To be clear, the term&nbsp;**pressure**&nbsp;means the ability to keep the opponent at their base. Having more pressure means they’re less likely to score, so keeping pressure is important, and you’ll see people making callouts about pressure when watching videos.

Everything you do is to get in the&nbsp;**best position**&nbsp;to score or to defend. The decisions you make very much impact the outcome of the game.

For example, double defending is a strategy where both you and your partner try to kill one opponent. In any case this is a bad decision, because you have no eyes on your other opponent and you'd waste time voiding again to defend them.&nbsp;**You're losing pressure.**&nbsp;Having a designated defender on your team should help avoid double defending.

You'll also avoid situations like&nbsp;[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eej2kS7SwyI&t=240).

Always remember that there are counters for all of the fundamentals. If the opponent towers over you there's always a way to combat it. You can counter their pushes but they can also counter yours. Playing more games of bridge will help you in decisions.

Here’s a few bridge videos for you to look at:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7et6xi7xcLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7et6xi7xcLc)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xwEsqpIPZI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xwEsqpIPZI)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcxB7oESkx8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcxB7oESkx8)

Notice the callouts they’re making and how the team coordinates.

In general,

Doubles teams have one attacker and one defender. The defender&nbsp; **hippos**&nbsp;while the attacker tries to kill the opposing attacker and build pressure. They do this through the fundamentals&nbsp; **towering**&nbsp;and&nbsp; **wallrunning**, as well as&nbsp; **winging**. The first push in a game is really important. While it’s possible to have a comeback, it’s unlikely.

Teams mode (4v4) have (in general) one defender, one support, and 2 attackers. The defender&nbsp;**hippos**&nbsp;while the support kills opposing attackers so the defender has time to hippo. The 2 attackers’ main objective is to get goals and build pressure, but also to kill opposing attackers.

In sweaty solo matches, you have a choice to either hippo or attack. The opponent would probably hippo so attacking gives you more high ground while hippoing is better for the long game. Most people who attack first hippo later anyways. The attacking first strategy works on maps like Sorcery and Aquatica, but not so much on Tundra. Hippoing on Urban, Cheesy, and Tundra is a no-brainer because it takes only a few seconds and it's effective.


### Map knowledge:

I have a gallery on bridge-maps&nbsp;[here.](https://seventown.xyz/gallerys/bridge-maps/)

Hippo maps include:&nbsp; **Sorcery, Mr Cheesy, Hyperfrost, Galaxy, Fortress, Flora, Dojo, Chronon, Boo, Atlantis, Aquatica, Urban, Tundra, Treehouse, Sunstone, and Stumped.**

Spawnblock maps are:&nbsp;**Lighthouse, Licorice, Condo, Twilight.**

You normally pristine on spawnblock maps and hippo on hippo maps.


## Community:

Of course, plain skill isn’t that great a motivator. So why should you be inclined to play this much and try to be this good?

I think the beauty in The Bridge is how&nbsp;**niche**&nbsp;it is. There’s not as many players as games like Skywars, Bedwars, etc.

That’s the best part. Because it’s a small community, it’s really easy to get to know everyone, and to become known yourself. I joined the community a few months after bridge was released and it didn’t take me long to start loving it. The community’s the whole reason I’ve stayed for a few years on this game, and you should give it a shot. Two discord servers stick out to me as a perfect way to get to know and make yourself known in the bridge community.


### Bridgers Discord:

Bridgers is the #1 Duels guild (in terms of GEXP) and its discord is the absolute hub for bridge players. This should be the first place you go to make friends in the bridge community. The members are pretty nice but you’ll have more fun if you make yourself known first. Say hi to people, make conversation, and you’ll have a lot more fun.

Here’s the link to the discord: [https://discord.gg/EUzJxcF](https://discord.gg/EUzJxcF)


### Ranked Bridge:

The Ranked Bridge discord is definitely an important place for new and old players alike. Run by an OG player known as OpenAI/Systeme, it’s filled with a lot of really good players and is the perfect way to build up your skill. You can only get better fighting people better than yourself, and concentrated gameplay with really good players is how I get better, and how a lot of other people get better.

Just remember that it’s okay if you lose elo. It’s about getting experience and learning from other players.

Here’s the link to the discord: [https://discord.gg/VvYhjMU](https://discord.gg/VvYhjMU)

This video is a good example of a ranked game. You can explore many other ranked games on youtube just by searching "Ranked Bridge"
